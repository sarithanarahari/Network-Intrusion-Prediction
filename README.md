# Network-Intrusion-Prediction
Model this problem as a BINARY classification problem. Use the following models to detect bad
connections (intrusions). Compare the accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score of ALL the models.
PRINT and PLOT the confusion matrix for each model. Show the ROC curve of each model.

• Logistic Regression

• Nearest Neighbor

• Support Vector Machine

• Gaussian Naive Bayes

• Fully-Connected Neural Networks

• Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

In all the models, encode good connections as “0” and bad connections as “1”.
